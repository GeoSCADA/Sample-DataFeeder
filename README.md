Sample code of data export tools using the ClearSCADA / Geo SCADA APIs.

This is offered as source code which you can build with Visual 
Studio. It is not supported or warranted in any way by Schneider Electric.

The source code is available for you to freely use, modify and extend to 
suit your requirements or that of your clients. It is perhaps not the 
most optimized, efficient or elegant code but we hope that its simplicity 
will encourage engagement with Geo SCADA explore the new ideas.

For a guide to implementing, running and customizing this sample, please see the PDF in this folder.

API Documentation is a help file installed by Geo SCADA. Find this on the Start menu in the EcoStruxure Geo SCADA group. It is called 'Client API Guide'.

When building, don't forget to remove and re-add ClearSCADA references so they match your installed version!
