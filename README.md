# Sample-DataFeeder
Geo SCADA Data Feeder Example Code.

Sample code of data export tools using the ClearSCADA / Geo SCADA APIs.

For a guide to implementing, running and customizing this sample, please see the PDF in this folder.

API Documentation is a help file installed by Geo SCADA. Find this on the Start menu in the EcoStruxure Geo SCADA group. It is called 'Client API Guide'.

When building, don't forget to remove and re-add ClearSCADA references so they match your installed version!
